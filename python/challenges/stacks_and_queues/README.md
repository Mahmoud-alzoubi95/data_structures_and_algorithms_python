# Stacks and Queues
Stacks & Queues it is the famous data structures in the world...
its good way to orgnize data and know how to deal with it

<br>

## Challenge
creating stacks & Queues methouds was one of the most good challenge to do, it was easy and learned alot about the algorithms..

<b>

## Approach & Efficiency
well for me .. i learned alot that is alot ways to slove proplem but always the best solution is which dosent need alot of time and memory to excute and get you the answer..
no mater how data you had..or even in worst case it is!!

## API
alot of methouds to use like:

for ***Stack***:
* push: it takes one value as argument and push it to the top of the stack
* pop: it pop the node in the top of the stack..
* peek: returns to you the value of the node in the top of the stack..
* is_empty: returns boolen if the stack is empty or not..

& for ***Queue***:
* enqueue: it takes one value as argument and add it to the rear of the queue
* dequeue: it pop the node in the fornt of the queue..
* peek: returns to you the value of the node in the front of the queue..
* isEmpty: returns boolen if the queue is empty or not..
